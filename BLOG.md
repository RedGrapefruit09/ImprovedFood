# About

This blog contains important info and announcements about the project that you shouldn't miss.  
_By the way it's not pretty, but I'm not going to make an entire website, so it's Markdown for now_

## Current plans

This section contains some info about the main plan of this project.  
Current release date is June 15th, 2021, may be delayed later on.  
There's only a single maintainer - me (RedGrapefruit09).

#### Release cycles

- 0.1 alpha. Mod core and vanilla food coverage
- 0.2 alpha. Crop core and about 15 custom crops
- 0.3 alpha. 15+ more crops
- 0.4 alpha. Tree crop core and 10-15 custom tree crops
- 0.5 beta. Random spawning of chests and plants around the world
- 0.6 beta. Custom food structures
- 0.7 beta. More food storage
- 0.8 beta. General polish and _maybe_ some texture redesigns
- 1.0 stable. The final milestone! Maybe some bugfixes, mainly content from previous release cycles

#### After 1.0 stable

After the 1.0 is released, there will be three types of updates to this project:

1. Bugfixes to patch things up
2. Polishing
3. New features and updates once in a month or two

I will support the mod **at least** until September 1st, 2021.  
After that, the future of the mod will be decided in this blog.

## May 28th, 2021

Today I've tried to port this mod to Kotlin and unfortunately failed.  
There were some critical incompatibilities and this project will stay on legacy Java indefinitely.

## May 27th, 2021

I've just fully ported MythicalTowers to Kotlin, and so far it's been great!  
If everything goes fine, on June 1st I'll be porting this mod.  
Usually Gradle & FLK setup, conversion, cleanup and compile error solving takes a few hours, so it'll take some time.

## May 26th, 2021

I'm back from the break! YAY!  
Been off to work on MythicalTowers, now back.  
I'll try to release Preview 7, Preview 8 and then 0.2 in the next couple of days.

## May 22nd, 2021

Lines of code badge stopped working and shows 'inaccessible', I don't know why.  
MythicalTowers progress has been going well at the expense of commit activity on this project.  
It'll make a few commits and possibly a new preview release tomorrow, we'll see how that goes!

## May 21st, 2021

I decided to un-private the new project, MythicalTowers,
because the code could be used for educational purposes later,
and I'd like to receive some contributions.

## May 20th, 2021

You may have seen the new project announced in the previous blog post - MythicalTowers.  
I have lots of research and planning to do, so I decided to private the project.  
When there'll be something to see, it'll go public (estimate - start of June).

## May 19th, 2021

I'm launching a new project in a few hours that will potentially receive more contributions than this one.

### Why
- This project inherits a bit _too much_ from Croptopia and at some point it might be just plagiarism 
- This project is in a phase where I can only add content. _I'm a programmer_, and I **don't** really like art
- Me not liking art led to copying some assets from Croptopia
- I want to take a fresh breath from working on this project

### What will happen to this project
- It **won't** be cancelled
- It will receive fewer contributions; probably 6-8 commits per week instead of 15-20
- The new project will be developed along this one

### What could happen to this project (this is pretty unlikely)
- It may stay in this repository and not be published on CurseForge
- The support might be shortened to a few months less
- **Happy news:** I might work on ImprovedFood 2.0 and make it much better than the first revision

### What will happen to the new project
- It will receive more updates and attention
- It will have some unique features and content, and I hope you'll like it
- It will have been released by the middle of July

## May 18th, 2021

So far I've been able to contribute fine to the project.  
The list of crops to add has been expanded, and I decided to split 0.2 into two releases (more info above).  
I also updated Fabric Loom to 0.7.32.  
It's not officially stable yet, but I had waited enough time on 0.6 Loom.  
I forgot to publish 0.2-preview.6; going to do that right after posting this.

## May 14th, 2021

I have 2 news today.  
First, I decided to make the Preview cycle of 0.2 more frequent, so there'll be more releases from now on.  
Second, on the next week I have a ton of exams, and it'll be very stressful. Prepare for low contribution rates.

## May 11th, 2021

Today 0.2 Preview 3 has been released.  
So far things have been going fine, but from now on previews will often be released every 2 or 3 days instead of every
day.  
I'm sorry about the difficulties that the project is currently facing, and I hope for the best product in the end.

## May 9th, 2021

Today I wanted to warn you about the next two weeks of this project.  
Since I study in school (yes, I know, this sounds pretty lame) I will be having exams in this time.  
I don't know if I'll be able to contribute to the project in that time, but I'll hope for the best.
