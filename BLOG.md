# About

This blog contains important info and announcements about the project that you shouldn't miss.  
_By the way it's not pretty, but I'm not going to make an entire website, so it's Markdown for now_

## Current plans

This section contains some info about the main plan of this project.  
Current release date is June 15th, 2021, may be delayed later on.  
There's only a single maintainer - me (RedGrapefruit09).

#### Release cycles

- 0.1 alpha. Mod core and vanilla food coverage
- 0.2 alpha. Crop core and about 15 custom crops
- 0.3 alpha. 15+ more crops
- 0.4 alpha. Tree crop core and 10-15 custom tree crops
- 0.5 beta. Random spawning of chests and plants around the world
- 0.6 beta. Custom food structures
- 0.7 beta. More food storage
- 0.8 beta. General polish and _maybe_ some texture redesigns
- 1.0 stable. The final milestone! Maybe some bugfixes, mainly content from previous release cycles

#### After 1.0 stable

After the 1.0 is released, there will be three types of updates to this project:

1. Bugfixes to patch things up
2. Polishing
3. New features and updates once in a month or two

I will support the mod **at least** until September 1st, 2021.  
After that, the future of the mod will be decided in this blog.

So far I've been able to contribute fine to the project.  
The list of crops to add has been expanded, and I decided to split 0.2 into two releases (more info above).  
I also updated Fabric Loom to 0.7.32.  
It's not officially stable yet, but I had waited enough time on 0.6 Loom.  
I forgot to publish 0.2-preview.6; going to do that right after posting this.

I have 2 news today.  
First, I decided to make the Preview cycle of 0.2 more frequent, so there'll be more releases from now on.  
Second, on the next week I have a ton of exams, and it'll be very stressful. Prepare for low contribution rates.

## May 11th, 2021

Today 0.2 Preview 3 has been released.  
So far things have been going fine, but from now on previews will often be released every 2 or 3 days instead of every
day.  
I'm sorry about the difficulties that the project is currently facing, and I hope for the best product in the end.

## May 9th, 2021

Today I wanted to warn you about the next two weeks of this project.  
Since I study in school (yes, I know, this sounds pretty lame) I will be having exams in this time.  
I don't know if I'll be able to contribute to the project in that time, but I'll hope for the best.
