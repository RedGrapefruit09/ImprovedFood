## What is this?

This is the archive of ImprovedFood project (revision 2).  
The project contained unique crops, features, food realism, (future) worldgen changes.  
The repository will be archived on GitHub (no further commits, PRs, issues etc.) on 15th June.

## Why did the project get archived?

Many reasons.  
Here are the biggest ones ordered by priority (from high to low):

1. **Huge feature overlap with Croptopia.**  
   Croptopia is [a famous Fabric mod](https://github.com/ExcessiveAmountsOfZombies/Croptopia) that  
   introduces many crops (both on land and on trees) and types of food into the game.  
   This mod had a similar idea, but introduced new worldgen, realism, storage and mechanics.  
   As a result, a major part of development was fully dedicated to copying/altering existing functionality from the mod.
2. **Size.**  
   Because of problem #1, the development was very long and tiring.  
   Only 20-30% of dev time was dedicated to unique features, and 70-80% to reimplementing Croptopia's functionality.
3. **Mentality of Content > Functionality.**  
   Most, if not all, of my work was towards making textures, content and _not programming_.  
   That may sound weird at first, but, as a programmer, I don't like focusing too much on content and art.
4. **Lack of modularity.**  
   Because the "realism" part of the mod added more difficulty, there needed to be options to turn on/off features.  
   Reworking the mod to support modularity would take even more time and effort.
5. **Demotivation.**  
   After focusing on a side project [MythicalTowers](https://github.com/RedGrapefruit09/MythicalTowers), I didn't want to work on the project anymore.  
   Because of problem #3, my attention was driven away and, as a result, there was a severe  
   lack of contributions for an in-active-development project.

## What next?

My final decision is to **convert** this project into a _plugin_ for Croptopia.  
That resolves many of the issues mentioned above:

1. Feature overlap is resolved because the foundation is provided by Croptopia - the base (dependency) mod.
2. The development time is cut and more unique features can be added.
3. There is no mentality of content > functionality because the focus is switched.
4. Modularity can easily be added as this is a new project.
