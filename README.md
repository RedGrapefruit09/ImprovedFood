<li>You can put your food into a fridge or salt it to reduce the speed of the process</li>
<li>Colorful and very detailed tooltips describing _everything_ about your food item</li>
<li>Food storage: boxes, lockers etc.</li>
<li>You can grow your food and make an astonishing farm</li>
<li>You can find your food on trees in jungles and forests</li>
<li>You can explore the world to find beautiful structures with lots of food and rare items</li>
<li>More to come later!</li>

# Contribute

I would love to receive pull requests, issues and contributions from this project's community.  
Although I'm not a full-time developer, and your pull request or issue might be reviewed after one or two days.  
I haven't set up code of conduct, pull request and issue templates yet. That will change later.

# Code

The code is written in Java 8 powered by AdoptOpenJDK 1.8  
It's carefully documented and commented to ensure readability.  
If you have refactoring or cleanup suggestions, open a pull request or issue, but there's a high chance I don't
approve.  
It's planned to port the mod to Kotlin using FLK (fabric-language-kotlin) after release.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Will this mod be ported to Forge?  
A: No. I do not develop using Forge and will not spend my time supporting a mod on both  
platforms instead of actually doing something useful with the mod itself.  
Q: Will there be a CurseForge page?  
A: Yes. After the mod is released I will send my request to upload the mod to CurseForge.  
Q: Do you support snapshots?  
A: No. I don't support snapshots and only update between stable releases of Minecraft and Fabric's toolchain.
